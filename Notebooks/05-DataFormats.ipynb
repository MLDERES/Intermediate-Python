    "# Getting Data\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll look at a few different data formats that are common in analytics.  This includes, delimited formats (.csv), extensible markup language (.xml) and javascript notation (.json) formats.  There are several other types of data files that you may come across, but these are common for a couple reasons.\n",
    "* Portability.  This means that the files can be shared across different kinds of computer operating systems without too much trouble\n",
    "* Readibility.  There is no special encoding for these files.  They can be created or opened with a standard text editor.  \n",
    "* Compatibility.  Because they are easy to pass around and simple to understand they are supported by lots and lots of platforms."

    "## Deliminited formats\n",
    "Probably the most common format for portable files is the delimited format (often comma-delimited).  In these files, each line represents a single record and the fields of each record are denoted by some kind of special separator character (usually a comma and sometimes a tab or space).  There are no rules for these kinds of files, just conventions.  For instance, the first line of the file is typically a \"header\" record.  This record serves to describe the contents in the rows that follow.  This makes is straightforward for someone reading the file to understanding what is expected in the data rows.  Take for instance\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> Id,Name,Phone Number\n",
    "> 1,Alice,555-1234\n",
    "> 2,Bob,555-0898\n",
    "> 3,Charlie,555-9099\n",
    "> 4,Doug,\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "In this example, we can see clearly that there are 4 records with the id values from 1 to 4.  The first record, that is with id 1, has a name of Alice and a Phone Number of 555-1234.  While we can easily see each of the other records- we can tell in this simple example that line 4 is missing a phone number.\n",
    "\n",
    "While easy to read for simple/small files - it becomes increasingly complex to read this file in a text editor if we are to try and find errors and missing values.  Fortunately, we can use the tools we have to import the file rather easily and find missing values, misaligned fields and generally interpret the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading/Writting Delimited Files\n",
    "We can certainly read data files line by line and processing them this way, but most often, for our purposes we are looking to do something specific like evaluate the data, use it for analysis or convert it to another format.  If you are interested in the nuts and bolts of reading files line by line then I would refer you to [this documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) or simply google 'reading csv file in Python'.  In order to use the data effectively, we'll depend instead on our ever useful and super-handy `pandas` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pandas` library actually can help us to read lots of different file formats from CSV files and Excel files, XML, JSON and even web pages (and suprisingly the clipboard!).  Mostly they work a lot alike, so we'll focus on the format and the nuances of the most common cases you'll run across.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional Parameters\n",
    "The `read_csv()` function takes a number of optional parameters, so it's best to be explicit about what you mean rather than calling the function and counting on the order of the parameters.  Recall that in a function definition if the parameter is defined with an `=` after it, this means the parameter is optional and if not specified will use the default value as specified in the parameter definition.  For instance, \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_func(a, b=0, c='all'):\n",
    "    print(a)\n",
    "    print(b)\n",
    "    print(c)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `a` is required, but `b` and `c` are optional.  This means you can specify values for these parameters and if you don't the defaults will be `0` and `\"all\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try this in the next cell.  Try a few of your own combinations until you get the hang of it."

The function definition can be intimidating because it has lots of options, but this is also helpful to ensure that the operation works exactly as we expect it to.  For instance, there are parameters which define what the delimiter is (especially if we choose not to use commas), an option to specify the field names, several parameters which help specify the date format (day first) and whether the file has an index defined in it.\n",
